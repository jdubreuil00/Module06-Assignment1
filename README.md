# Integer Sorting Project

## **Purpose**
The Integer Sorting Project is designed to take in a set of integers and  sort them into either a linked list or a stack collection.

## **Features**
Written in Java using Java Collections for efficient data handling.
Allows sorting of integers into either a linked list or a stack collection based on which program you are using.

## **Setup Instructions**
Before running the programs, ensure you have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system.

### **Linked List Sorting (Assignment4)**
Navigate to the Assignment4 folder.
Refer to the Assignment4ReadMeJordanDubreuil.txt file in that folder for detailed instructions on how to run the linked list sorting program.
Explore the docs folder for JavaDoc documentation to understand the code structure and usage.
### **Stack Sorting (Assignment5)**
Navigate to the StackSorting folder.
Refer to the Assignment5ReadMeJordanDubreuil.txt file in that folder for detailed instructions on how to run the stack sorting program.
Explore the docs folder for JavaDoc documentation to understand the code structure and usage.
## **Additional Documentation**
JavaDoc documentation for each program is available in the docs folder of their respective directories. This documentation provides insights into the classes, methods, and overall structure of the code.
